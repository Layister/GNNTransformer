To visualize Figure 2 in our manuscript, please use the **'Figure2.ipynb'** notebook, which is based on the R language. Ensure R is enabled in your Jupyter notebook; if not, install the IRkernel package in R with these commands:

install.packages('IRkernel')
IRkernel::installspec(user = FALSE)

To run the notebook, simply adjust the following paths: base_result_path for the TransformerST output, base_data_path for spatial transcriptomics data, and base_output_path to visualize the ARI for all 12 samples.

The data and results are accessible through the following link:

For your reference, we provide the original R code. The 'DLPFC.ARI_boxplot.R' script was used to generate Figure 2c, while 'DLPFC_comp.R' produced Figures 2a and 2b. Additionally, 'DLPFC_BayesSpace.R' is tailored for BayesSpace analyses and comparisons with other methods, and 'DLPFC_SpaGCN' is for running SpaGCN results."
